It has been used in various religious traditions and philosophies to illustrate the nature of truth, reality, and human perception. The story goes like this A group of blind men encounters an elephant for the first time. Each man touches a different part of the elephant, such as the trunk, tusk, ear, leg, or tail. Based on their limited individual experiences, they try to describe what an elephant is like. The man who touches the trunk says that an elephant is like a snake. The one who touches the tusk believes it is like a spear. The man who touches the ear describes it as a fan, while the one who touches the leg thinks it is like a tree trunk. The man who touches the tail concludes that an elephant is like a rope. Each blind man is convinced that their perspective is correct and that the others are wrong. This leads to disagreement and conflict among them. However, they are all partially correct, as they each experienced a different aspect of the same elephant. The complete truth about the elephant can only be understood by combining their perspectives. The metaphor of the blind men and the elephant serves as a reminder that our individual perceptions and experiences can lead to incomplete or distorted understandings of reality. It encourages us to be open to diverse perspectives and to seek a more comprehensive understanding of the truth.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="https://aquaponiccowboy.github.io/aquaponiccowboy-com/jekyll/update/2024/06/18/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2024-06-18T19:45:12+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-18T19:45:12+00:00</updated><id>https://aquaponiccowboy.github.io/aquaponiccowboy-com/jekyll/update/2024/06/18/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aquaponiccowboy.github.io/aquaponiccowboy-com/jekyll/update/2024/06/18/welcome-to-jekyll.html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
